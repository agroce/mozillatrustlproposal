Individuals cannot be empowered, safe, and independent if the Internet is unreliable, unsafe, insecure, and untrustworthy.  A global public resource, to serve the public well, must be based on the foundation of a solid, secure, foundation, just as a democratic and free polity relies on a sound infrastructure of roads, bridges, and public transportation.

Rust is increasingly used in the tools that Mozilla's technologists product in pursuit of keeping the Internet alive and accessible.  For example, security and privacy are social policies, but part of that social policy is devoting sufficient and suitable resources to the technical aspects of security and privacy, for examples.  Rust helps avoid the vulnerabilities that weaken the guarantees of security and privacy on the Internet; powerful automated testing for Rust systems, supporting more complex specifications of security and privacy, can further advance this critical goal.
